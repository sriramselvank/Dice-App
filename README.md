A Dice app, my first interactive app.

Learning:
1) Learned to implement IBAction and IBOutlet with UIbutton, which in turn triggered the two image view to show random dice image as result.
2) Getting comfortable with the storyboard, learned using constraints effectively with the view and stack view.
3) Used array to store the images of the dice using Image literals and randomize both dice using randomElement().
